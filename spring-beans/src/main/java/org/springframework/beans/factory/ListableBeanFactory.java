/**
 *
 * 自己的理解：
 * 		获取bean时,Spring 鼓励使用这个接口定义的api. 还有个Beanfactory方便使用.其他的4个接口都是不鼓励使用的.
 * 		提供容器中bean迭代的功能,不再需要一个个bean地查找.比如可以一次获取全部的bean(太暴力了),根据类型获取bean.在看
 * 		SpringMVC时,扫描包路径下的具体实现策略就是使用的这种方式(那边使用的是BeanFactoryUtils封装的api).
 *
 * 		 如果同时实现了HierarchicalBeanFactory,返回值不会考虑父类BeanFactory,只考虑当前factory定义的类.当然也可以使用
 *		 BeanFactoryUtils辅助类来查找祖先工厂中的类.
 *
 *		  这个接口中的方法只会考虑本factory定义的bean.这些方法会忽略ConfigurableBeanFactory的registerSingleton注册的单例
 *		  bean(getBeanNamesOfType和getBeansOfType是例外,一样会考虑手动注册的单例).当然BeanFactory的getBean一样可以透
 * 		  明访问这些特殊bean.当然在典型情况下,所有的bean都是由external bean定义,所以应用不需要顾虑这些差别.
 *		 注意:getBeanDefinitionCount和containsBeanDefinition的实现方法因为效率比较低,还是少用为好.
 * 翻译：
 * 可列出的BeanFactory
 * ListableBeanFactory接口是BeanFactory接口的一个扩展。
 * 可以枚举其所有bean实例 ，而不是尝试按客户的要求按名称一一查找bean。
 * 预加载其所有bean定义的BeanFactory实现（例如基于XML的工厂）可以实现此接口。
 *
 * Extension of the {@link BeanFactory} interface to be implemented by bean factories
 * that can enumerate all their bean instances, rather than attempting bean lookup
 * by name one by one as requested by clients. BeanFactory implementations that
 * preload all their bean definitions (such as XML-based factories) may implement
 * this interface.
 *
 * 理论上讲，一般来说此类的实现类同时也实现了HierarchicalBeanFactory。
 *
 * 此接口中方法返回值也不应该考虑其父BeanFactory中的Bean，但是你可以通过BeanFactoryUtils工具类来获取哪些在父BeanFactory中的Bean。
 *
 * <p>If this is a {@link HierarchicalBeanFactory}, the return values will <i>not</i>
 * take any BeanFactory hierarchy into account, but will relate only to the beans
 * defined in the current factory. Use the {@link BeanFactoryUtils} helper class
 * to consider beans in ancestor factories too.
 *
 * 此接口中的方法将仅遵守该工厂的bean定义。
 * 他们将忽略通过其他方式（例如{@link org.springframework.beans.factory.config.ConfigurableBeanFactory#registerSingleton(String, Object)}注册的任何单例bean，
 * 但{@code getBeanNamesOfType }和{@code getBeansOfType}也会检查这样的手动注册的单例。
 * 当然，BeanFactory的{@code getBean} 确实允许透明访问此类特殊bean。
 * 但在典型的场景中，无论如何，所有bean都将由外部bean定义来定义，因此大多数应用程序不需要担心这种区别。
 *
 * <p>The methods in this interface will just respect bean definitions of this factory.
 * They will ignore any singleton beans that have been registered by other means like
 * {@link org.springframework.beans.factory.config.ConfigurableBeanFactory}'s
 * {@code registerSingleton} method, with the exception of
 * {@code getBeanNamesOfType} and {@code getBeansOfType} which will check
 * such manually registered singletons too. Of course, BeanFactory's {@code getBean}
 * does allow transparent access to such special beans as well. However, in typical
 * scenarios, all beans will be defined by external bean definitions anyway, so most
 * applications don't need to worry about this differentiation.
 *
 * 注意：除了{@code getBeanDefinitionCount} 和{@code containsBeanDefinition}之外，此接口中其他方法的实现可能不会太高效，因此，不建议经常调用。
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> With the exception of {@code getBeanDefinitionCount}
 * and {@code containsBeanDefinition}, the methods in this interface
 * are not designed for frequent invocation. Implementations may be slow.
